# ANWI - All New Wireless IDS

ANWI is a new type of Wireless Intrusion Detection System which is based on a low cost Wi-Fi module (ESP8266) and can be deployed at the physical perimeter of the coverage area. It allows organizations that cannot afford expensive WIDS solutions to protect their networks at a fraction of the cost.
